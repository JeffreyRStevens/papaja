`papaja` is an R package that facilitates creating reproducible, submission-ready manuscripts which conform to the American Psychological Association (APA) manuscript guidelines (6th Edition). `papaja` provides

- an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) template that can be used with (or without) [RStudio](http://www.rstudio.com/) to create PDF documents (using the [apa6](http://www.ctan.org/pkg/apa6) LaTeX class) or Word documents (using a .docx-reference file).
- Functions to **typeset** the results from **statistical analyses**,
- functions to create **tables**, and
- functions to create **figures** in accordance with APA guidelines.
  

## Example

Take a look at the [R Markdown file](https://github.com/crsh/papaja/blob/master/inst/example/example.rmd) of the example manuscript in the folder `example` and the resulting [PDF](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/crsh/papaja/master/inst/example/example.pdf).
The example document also contains some basic instructions.
For an in-depth introduction to `papaja`, check out the current draft of the [manual](https://crsh.github.io/papaja_man/).
If the manual does not answer your question, ask a question on Stack Overflow [using the `papaja` tag](https://t.co/Z3auyUrbTa).
If you believe your problem is related to a bug or you want to request a new feature, [open an issue](https://github.com/crsh/papaja/issues) on Github.


## Installation

To use `papaja` you need either an up-to-date version of [RStudio](http://www.rstudio.com/) or [pandoc](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/).
If you want to create PDF- in addition to DOCX-documents you additionally need
a [TeX](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/TeX) distribution.
If you have no use for TeX beyond rendering R Markdown documents, I recommend you use [TinyTex](https://yihui.name/tinytex/).
TinyTex can be installed from within R as follows.

```{r eval = FALSE}
if(!"tinytex" %in% rownames(installed.packages())) install.packages("tinytex")

tinytex::install_tinytex()
```

Otherwise consider [MikTeX](http://miktex.org/) for Windows, [MacTeX](https://tug.org/mactex/) for Mac, or [TeX Live](http://www.tug.org/texlive/) for Linux.
Please refer to the [`papaja` manual](https://crsh.github.io/papaja_man/introduction.html#getting-started) for detailed installation instructions.

`papaja` is not yet available on CRAN but you can install it from this repository:

```{r install_papapja, eval = FALSE}
# Install remotes package if necessary
if(!"remotes" %in% rownames(installed.packages())) install.packages("remotes")

# Install the stable development verions from GitHub
remotes::install_github("crsh/papaja")

# Install the latest development snapshot from GitHub
remotes::install_github("crsh/papaja@devel")
```


## How to use papaja
Once `papaja` is installed, you can select the APA template when creating a new R Markdown file through the RStudio menus.

![APA template selection](inst/images/template_selection.png)

If you want to add citations specify your BibTeX-file in the YAML front matter of the document (`bibliography: my.bib`) and you can start citing. If necessary, have a look at R Markdown's [overview of the citation syntax](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/authoring_bibliographies_and_citations.html). You may also be interested in [citr](https://github.com/crsh/citr), an R Studio addin to swiftly insert Markdown citations.

### Helper functions to report analyses
The functions `apa_print()` and `apa_table()` facilitate reporting results of your analyses. Take a look at the [R Markdown-file](https://github.com/crsh/papaja/blob/master/inst/example/example.Rmd) of the example manuscript in the folder `example` and the resulting [PDF](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/crsh/papaja/master/inst/example/example.pdf).

Drop a supported analysis result, such as an `htest`- or `lm`-object, into `apa_print()` and receive a list of possible character strings that you can use to report the results of your analysis.

```{r echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, results = 'hide'}
library("papaja")
```

```{r}
my_lm <- lm(Sepal.Width ~ Sepal.Length + Petal.Width + Petal.Length, data = iris)
apa_lm <- apa_print(my_lm)
```

One element of this list is `apa_lm$table` that, in the case of an `lm`-object, will contain a complete regression table. Pass `apa_lm$table` to `apa_table()` to turn it into a proper table in your PDF or Word document.

```{r eval = FALSE}
apa_table(apa_lm$table, caption = "Iris regression table.")
```

<!-- GitHub markdown doesn't support MathJax -->

---

Table. *Iris regression table.*

| Predictor     | *b*   | 95% CI          | *t(146)*   | *p*       |
|:--------------|------:|:---------------:|-----------:|----------:|
| Intercept     | 1.04  |  [0.51, 1.58]   | 3.85       | &lt; .001 |
| Sepal Length  | 0.61  |  [0.48, 0.73]   | 9.77       | &lt; .001 |
| Petal Width   | 0.56  |  [0.32, 0.80]   | 4.55       | &lt; .001 |
| Petal Length  | -0.59 |  [-0.71, -0.46] | -9.43      | &lt; .001 |

---

`papaja` currently provides methods for the following object classes:

```{r echo = FALSE, results = "asis"}
print_classes <- gsub("apa_print\\.", "", as.character(utils::methods("apa_print")))
print_classes <- print_classes[!grepl(",", print_classes)]
print_classes <- c(print_classes, rep(NA,  (4 - length(print_classes) %% 4) * (length(print_classes) %% 4 > 0)))
print_classes <- matrix(print_classes, ncol = 4)
colnames(print_classes) <- apply(print_classes, 2, function(x) {
  first_letters <- tolower(substr(x, 1, 1))
  first_letters <- c(first_letters[1], tail(first_letters, 1))
  first_letters[is.na(first_letters)] <- "z"
  col_names <- if(first_letters[1] == first_letters[2]) first_letters[1] else paste(first_letters, collapse = "-")
  toupper(col_names)
})
print_classes[is.na(print_classes)] <- ""
print_classes[grepl("lsm|emm|glht|ref\\.grid|BayesFactor", print_classes)] <- paste0(print_classes[grepl("lsm|emm|glht|ref\\.grid|BayesFactor", print_classes)], "<sup>*</sup>")

knitr::kable(print_classes)
```

\* Not fully tested, don't trust blindly!


### Plot functions

Be sure to also check out `apa_barplot()`, `apa_lineplot()`, and `apa_beeplot()` (or the general function `apa_factorial_plot()`) if you work with factorial designs:

```{r include = FALSE}
set.seed(42L)
x <- expand.grid(
  id = seq_len(80L)
  , congruency = c("Congruent", "Incongruent")
  , load       = c("High", "Low")
)

x[["response_time"]] <- rt(nrow(x), df = 20) * 80 + 
  (x$congruency == "Congruent") * - 80 + 
  (x$load == "High") * 40 + 
  500


variable_labels(x) <- list(
  congruency = "Congruency"
  , load = "Cognitive load"
  , response_time = "Response time"
)
stroop_data <- x
```

```{r stroop-plot, fig.cap = "Response times from a simulated Stroop experiment. Large dots represent condition means, small dots represent individual participants' mean response time. Error bars represent 99% within-subjects confidence intervals."}
par(las = 1)

apa_beeplot(
  data = stroop_data
  , dv = "response_time"
  , id = "id"
  , factors = c("congruency", "load")
  , ylim = c(0, 800)
  , dispersion = wsci # within-subjects confidence intervals
  , conf.level = .99
)
```

If you prefer creating your plots with `ggplot2` try `theme_apa()`.


### Using papaja without RStudio
Don't use RStudio? No problem. Use the `rmarkdown::render` function to create articles:

~~~r
# Create new R Markdown file
rmarkdown::draft(
  "mymanuscript.Rmd"
  , "apa6"
  , package = "papaja"
  , create_dir = FALSE
  , edit = FALSE
)

# Render manuscript
rmarkdown::render("mymanuscript.Rmd")
~~~


### Computational reproducibility

To ensure mid- to long-term computation reproducibility we highly recommend conserving the software environment used to write a manuscript (e.g. R and all R packages) either in a software container or a virutal machine.
This way you can be sure that your R code does not break because of updates to R or any R package.
For a brief primer on containers and virtual machines see [the supplementary material](https://psych-transparency-guide.uni-koeln.de/analytic-reproducibility.html#document-hardware-and-software-used-for-analyses) by Klein et al. (2018).

[Docker](https://www.docker.com/) is the most widely used containerization approach.
It is open source and free to use but requires some disk space.
[CodeOcean](https://codeocean.com/) is a commercial service that builds on Docker, facilitates setting up and sharing containers and lets you run computations in the cloud.
See the manual on [how to get started using `papaja` with Docker or CodeOcean](https://crsh.github.io/papaja_man/tips-and-tricks.html#reproducible-software-environments).

There are also many additional analyses that we would like `apa_print()` to support.
